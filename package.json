Sure, here's an example of a `package.json` file for a Node.js project that could be the backend of your API-first automation platform for DevOps:

```json
{
  "name": "devops-automation-platform",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Streamline your DevOps processes with our API-first automation platform, reducing deployment times and minimizing errors to significantly boost productivity and ROI.",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "build": "npm run clean && npm run compile",
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "compile": "babel src -d dist"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "devops",
    "automation",
    "api",
    "deployment",
    "productivity",
    "roi"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name or Company",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "mongoose": "^7.0.1",

  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0",

  - **dotenv**: To manage environment variables.

- **DevDependencies**:
  - **nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server upon code changes during development.
  - **jest**: A testing framework to ensure the quality and reliability of your code.
  - **eslint**: A tool for identifying and fixing issues in the JavaScript codebase.
  - **rimraf**: A cross-platform tool for deleting files and directories.
  - **babel-cli** and **babel-preset-env**: Transpiling ES6+ JavaScript code for broader compatibility.
